# IRON-HACK
Foundational Data Analysis

Here we can found 2 MAIN exercises that you can look for if u need some help on this course or maybe if you want to learn and check some python advices. On the top of the repository you can see the previous work of this course in which we have some abstracted exercise gapped into different parts of this lenguaje: Lists, Dictionaries, Operations...

HERE IS A TEST THAT U CAN SOLVE AND CHECK IT ON THE FILE UPLOADED BEFORE, GOOD LUCK

a) True

b) False


9. What would be the output of the following code? ```python a_dict = {'hello': 'peter', 'hi': 'Sam', 'Hey': 'Frodo'} for item in a_dict: print(item) ```
